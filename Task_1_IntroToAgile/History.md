Agile was developed in response to the limitations of the waterfall method, a structured approach from the 1950s and 1960s used for software development. 

Waterfall followed a sequential process with distinct phases like requirements, design, development, and testing, and it allowed little room for change once a phase was complete. While this method provided tight control over scope and a simple process, it had significant drawbacks: delays from incomplete tasks in one phase, difficulty in responding to changes, and limited customer input during early phases where their feedback was crucial.

As software development evolved, trends like design thinking, cheaper computing resources, and a demand for quicker delivery led to a shift away from waterfall. Collaboration and flexibility became essential, fostering the need for a more adaptable methodology. Agile emerged as a solution, offering flexibility, continuous improvement, and the ability to handle frequent changes more efficiently.
