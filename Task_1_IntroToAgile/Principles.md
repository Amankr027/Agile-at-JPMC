# Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto

We follow these principles:

1. **Customer Satisfaction:**  
   Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. **Embrace Change:**  
   Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

3. **Frequent Delivery:**  
   Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.

4. **Collaboration:**  
   Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. **Empowered Teams:**  
   Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. **Face-to-Face Communication:**  
   The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7. **Working Software:**  
   Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. **Sustainable Development:**  
   Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. **Technical Excellence:**  
   Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. **Simplicity:**  
    Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.

11. **Self-Organizing Teams:**  
    The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. **Reflection and Adjustment:**  
    At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
