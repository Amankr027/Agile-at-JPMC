# Introducing Agile!

Starting in the 1990s and formalized in 2001, the Agile Manifesto led to the development of the Agile method. This redefined the development cycle as iterative, incremental, and collaborative with shared responsibility, rather than the sequential, siloed approach of the past. Agile breaks software into smaller functionality sets, each designed, built, tested, and released in repeating waves or “sprints” with direct customer collaboration throughout the cycle.

## Agile Values (from the Agile Manifesto):
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Agile introduced the concept of the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**, which is the smallest functional version of a product that meets customer needs. The MVP allows validation of customer requirements and software viability at the lowest cost and risk, before adding more features.

## Advantages of the Agile Method:
- Designed to expect and accommodate changes in scope and design.
- Quick adjustments based on customer feedback.
- Early and frequent delivery of useful value, starting with the MVP.
- Faster production deployment with lower risk and higher ROI compared to the waterfall method.

## Agile in Practice:
Agile isn't just used in software engineering and IT; it has applications in manufacturing, marketing, supply chain, and other business areas. Over the last 20 years, more than 40 Agile implementations have been developed for various industries.

### Scrum - The Most Popular Agile Framework
JPMC (and many others) uses several Agile methods, including **Kanban** and **eXtreme Programming (XP)**. However, the most frequently used is **Scrum**, which is popular in software development. Scrum focuses on:
- Self-managed, cross-functional teams
- Short, time-boxed work periods called **sprints**
- Structured process reviews and continuous improvement
