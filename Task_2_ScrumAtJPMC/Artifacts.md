# Scrum Artifacts

Scrum artifacts are tools that provide transparency and enable inspection and adaptation within the Scrum framework. Each artifact contains a commitment against which progress can be measured. The three main artifacts are:

## 1. Product Backlog
- **Definition**: An ordered list of user requirements and tasks needed to improve the product.
- **Ownership**: Managed by the Product Owner.
- **Commitment**: The **Product Goal** (long-term objective for the product).

## 2. Sprint Backlog
- **Definition**: An ordered list of selected backlog items for a specific sprint, including a plan to achieve the Sprint Goal.
- **Ownership**: Managed by the Scrum Team, particularly the developers.
- **Commitment**: The **Sprint Goal** (overall objective for the sprint).

## 3. Increment
- **Definition**: The sum of all completed Product Backlog items at the end of a sprint.
- **Quality Assurance**: Must meet the **Definition of Done** (quality criteria for completion).
- **Commitment**: The **Definition of Done**, ensuring increments are potentially shippable.

## Importance of Scrum Artifacts
- **Transparency**: Provides visibility into project progress and state.
- **Inspection and Adaptation**: Enables regular reviews and process improvements.
