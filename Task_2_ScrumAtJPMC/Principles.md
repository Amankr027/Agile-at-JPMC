# Three Principles of Scrum

The Scrum process is built upon three key principles:

### 1. Transparency
- The development process and work must be visible to those involved and the stakeholders.
- Development decisions are often made collectively based on the current state of the **Scrum artifacts**.
- Full transparency is crucial to enable effective **inspection**.

### 2. Inspection
- Scrum artifacts and progress towards goals must be inspected regularly to detect issues or undesirable variances.
- Scrum incorporates **four events** during a sprint to organize inspection.
- Inspection leads to **adaptation** when problems are detected.

### 3. Adaptation
- When a process or product deviates from acceptable limits, it must be adjusted as soon as possible.
- The earlier the adaptation, the less deviation occurs.
- Scrum teams must be empowered and self-managing to effectively adapt through **continuous learning** during inspection.
