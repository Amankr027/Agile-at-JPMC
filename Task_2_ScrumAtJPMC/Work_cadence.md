# Scrum Work Cadence

The sprint is the heart of the Scrum work cadence. At JPMC, sprints are two weeks long and synchronized to a universal calendar for efficient management. Sprints occur sequentially, with each new sprint starting immediately after the previous one ends. Each sprint acts as a mini-project, where all team work is conducted. 

## Key Principles
- No changes that endanger the sprint goal are allowed during a sprint.
- Quality is maintained according to the agreed Definition of Done.
- The Product Backlog can be refined or adjusted as needed.
- The Sprint Backlog's scope may be clarified or renegotiated with the Product Owner.

The short duration of sprints encourages regular inspection and adaptation, fostering continuous improvement and rapid progress toward the product goal while minimizing project risk.

## Key Events in a Sprint
1. **Sprint Planning**
   - Held at the start of the sprint.
   - Team plans which Product Backlog items will be included and assigns responsibilities.
   - Definitions of Done are reviewed and agreed upon.

2. **Product Backlog Refinement**
   - Conducted as needed during sprints.
   - New items are added, existing items are detailed and estimated using techniques like story points.

3. **Daily Standup**
   - A brief daily meeting (usually 15 minutes) where team members share updates on their progress, completed tasks, and any blockers.

4. **Sprint Review and Retrospective**
   - **Sprint Review**: At the end of the sprint, the team demonstrates their work to stakeholders for feedback.
   - **Sprint Retrospective**: The team reflects on their processes and teamwork, discussing successes and areas for improvement.

At JPMC, we prioritize the skills and teamwork needed to build high-performing Agile Scrum teams, providing necessary training, feedback, and support for success and excellence.
